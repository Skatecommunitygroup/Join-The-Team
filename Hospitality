California style burger
To cook a California-style burger, form seasoned ground beef patties, cook them on a grill or skillet, add melted cheese, and pile high on a toasted bun with fresh toppings like sliced avocado, lettuce, and tomato.

Making a California-style burger involves preparing seasoned ground beef patties, cooking them, melting cheese on top, and assembling them on a toasted bun with various fresh ingredients.

Essential ingredients include ground beef, hamburger buns, cheese (like Monterey Jack or Swiss), avocado, lettuce, and tomato. Other potential toppings are red onion and bacon. A simple spread can be made from mayonnaise and Dijon mustard.

For seasoning the ground beef, ingredients such as Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper can be used. After seasoning, form the beef into patties. Prepare the fresh toppings like slicing the avocado, tomato, and red onion.

Toast the hamburger buns. Cook the patties on a grill or pan. During the last minute of cooking, add the cheese to melt.

To assemble, spread the mayonnaise-Dijon mixture on the bottom bun. Layer with lettuce, tomato, the cheeseburger patty, avocado, red onion, and bacon if desired. The burger is completed by adding the top bun. Serve the burger immediately after assembly.
